;; This module defines import/include handling for C++ and Java.
;;
;; To use, add this to your .emacs:
;;    (require 'code-imports)
;;
;; You will also need to define `code-imports-project-directory' to
;; define the project root so that this module can make sense of
;; grabbed imports.
;;
;; Then, when you are on a .h and .java file that you want to import
;; into .cc or .java file, respectively, use:
;;
;; M-x code-imports-grab-import
;;
;; Grab as many imports as you want, then go to the .cc or .java file
;; you want to use, and use:
;;
;; M-x code-imports-add-grabbed-imports
;;
;; This will add the imports to the file, and then organize your
;; imports in accordance with a particlar style (by default set to the
;; Google style guide).
;;
;; You can also just organize your imports with:
;;
;; M-x code-imports-organize-imports
